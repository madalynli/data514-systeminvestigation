    "The purpose of this notebook is to document the steps taken to produce the cleaned and final versions of the Airbnb datasets used for the analysis and the queries in Part 4 of the System Investigation Project. Cleaning and condensing the Airbnb datasets is necessary as part of the analysis because the queries do not require all the columns on the original dataset and condensing it actually saves a lot of processing time and storage space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Airbnb data is derived from the source [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) which contains files of data for airbnb listings, calendar bookings, reviews, and neighborhoods of various cities and countries. For the purpose of this project, we were asked to focus on the following cities in the US: Los Angeles, Portland, Salem, and San Diego. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The three question/queries that I have selected to answer for this project are listed as follows:\n",
    "1. Display list of stays in Portland, OR with details: name, neighbourhood, room type, how many guests it accommodates, property type and amenities, per night’s cost and is available for the next two days in descending order of rating.\n",
    "2. Are there any neighbourhoods in any of the cities that don’t have any listings?\n",
    "3. For each city, how many reviews are received for December of each year?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the queries listed above, I will only be cleaning two of the data files for each city. They are Listings and Reviews. More details about the process and steps to clean these files are mentioned in more detail below. For the Neighborhoods and Calendar columns, there was not much to update or alter in the original files so for simplicity, we can keep the original files as is that are directly downloaded from the site.
